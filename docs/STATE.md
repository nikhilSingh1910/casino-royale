## What we're building

**A free-to-play virtual cricket betting game.** Play-money only, forever — virtual chips with no
cash value, no deposits, no withdrawals (**D32**, the governing scope decision). The cricket
mechanics mirror the reference platforms (match-odds / bookmaker / fancy-session markets); the chips
just don't convert to money.

> **This reframed the project on 2026-08-04.** It was specified and built as a *licensed real-money*
> platform; the client then confirmed play-money only. Roughly half the prior scope — licensing,
> KYC/AML, real payments, chargebacks, statutory RG, regulatory reporting — is **out of scope under
> D32**. Those docs are kept as reference (and for any future real-money pivot), not deleted. The
> cricket engine itself is unchanged.

## Phase

**Phase 0/1 — foundations + cricket engine. No code written yet.**

In place: `PRD.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/MILESTONES.md`,
`docs/CRICKET-MVP.md` (**the active build**), `docs/REVIEW-FINDINGS.md`, and the decision log
(**D1–D32**, append-only).

**Nothing blocks the build.** The four M1-gating architectural decisions were signed off
(D28–D31, though D31/chargebacks is now void under D32) and D6 confirmed (D27). B1 (jurisdiction) no
longer gates us — with no real money, licensing is the client's concern, not a Tech gate.

## In scope (play-money)

- **Cricket engine** — feed, markets (match-odds / bookmaker / fancy-session), operator pricing,
  in-play suspension/repricing, ball-by-ball settlement. `docs/CRICKET-MVP.md`.
- **Chip-economy ledger** — clean double-entry so chips can't be duplicated or lost. Bar is *game
  integrity*, not financial audit.
- **Accounts** — login + chip balance + chip top-ups (free / daily bonus / etc.), no verification tiers.
- **Feed** — cricbuzz11 or any cheap source is fine (no money settles; D26's accountability bar is gone).

## Out of scope under D32 (kept as reference)

Gambling licence + jurisdiction gating · KYC/AML (M5) · statutory RG + self-exclusion registers (M6)
· real payments + Hyperswitch (M7, D7) · chargebacks + dispute-suspense (D31) · regulatory reporting
(M12) · player-funds segregation · gaming duty / financial model.

## Open — worth a decision, not blocking

- **Trim the infra stack?** For play-money chips, **Hyperswitch is cut** (no payments); **immudb
  (D8) and TigerBeetle (D5) are arguably overkill** — the game-integrity bar may be met by a simpler
  store. Not yet re-decided; flagged in D32.
- **Currency** collapses to one chip currency (D30 simplified).
- **Monetisation** (ads / subscription / engagement) and app-store "simulated gambling" rules — the
  client's business/legal call (Appendix A.5), not Tech's.

## Next actions

1. **Decide the infra trim** (above) before M1 — it changes the ledger workstream.
2. **Begin M0 — scaffold** (`docs/MILESTONES.md`): repo structure, layer-boundary lint,
   config-at-boot, CI rules. Nothing gates it.
3. **M1 — chip ledger** to the signed-off money decisions (D28 reserve, D29 sync; one currency).
4. **Cricket engine (CM1→CM6)** on `docs/CRICKET-MVP.md` — feed → markets → placement → settlement.
   No real-money track to run in parallel now, so this *is* the path to a playable product.

## Notes

- Several regulatory figures in `PRD.md` §10 were never verified (`REVIEW-FINDINGS.md` §8b) — now
  moot under D32, but left flagged rather than presented as fact.
- Part I of `PRD.md` (reference-platform analysis) was produced entirely from public sources; no
  credentials are in this repository. The top5050 HAR analysis (data model) came from a capture the
  client provided.
